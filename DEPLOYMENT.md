# Deployment Guide

Your React application has been successfully built for production! üöÄ

## Build Status
‚úÖ Production build completed successfully
‚úÖ Build output located in `dist/` folder
‚úÖ Production preview tested and working

## Build Output
- **Size**: ~69KB CSS, optimized JavaScript bundle
- **Location**: `dist/` folder
- **Assets**: Minified and optimized for production

## Deployment Options

### 1. Vercel (Recommended)
```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm i -g vercel

# Deploy
vercel --prod
```

### 2. Netlify
```bash
# Install Netlify CLI
npm i -g netlify-cli

# Deploy
netlify deploy --prod --dir=dist
```

### 3. GitHub Pages
1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Go to repository Settings > Pages
3. Set source to "GitHub Actions"
4. Create `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`:

```yaml
name: Deploy to GitHub Pages

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '18'
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm run build
      - uses: actions/deploy-pages@v1
        with:
          path: dist
```

### 4. Firebase Hosting
```bash
# Install Firebase CLI
npm i -g firebase-tools

firebase init hosting
firebase deploy
```

### 5. Static File Hosting
Simply upload the contents of the `dist/` folder to any static hosting service:
- AWS S3 + CloudFront
- DigitalOcean Spaces
- Cloudflare Pages
- Surge.sh

## Environment Variables
Make sure to configure these environment variables in your hosting platform:
- `VITE_SUPABASE_PROJECT_ID`
- `VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`
- `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`

## Performance Notes
‚ö†Ô∏è **Bundle Size Warning**: Some chunks are larger than 500KB. Consider:
- Using dynamic imports for code splitting
- Implementing lazy loading for routes
- Optimizing dependencies

## Testing Production Build Locally
```bash
npm run preview
```
This serves the production build at http://localhost:4173/
